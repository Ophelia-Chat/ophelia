# Ophelia üå∏

Ophelia is a minimalist, SwiftUI-based chatbot interface designed for smooth and engaging conversations. It supports both OpenAI and Anthropic models and offers speech synthesis, customizable settings, and a system message field to tailor the AI‚Äôs behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> The app is under active development and debugging. Some features may be unstable or require further configuration.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Multiple Providers**: Seamlessly switch between OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude models.
- **Model Selection & System Message**: Choose from various AI models and set a system message to guide the assistant‚Äôs style and behavior.
- **Speech Integration**: Autoplay responses using system voices or OpenAI-based TTS.
- **Automatic Settings Persistence**: Settings changes are saved automatically, so your provider, model, and API keys persist across sessions.

## Requirements üóùÔ∏è

**API Keys**:  
You must provide a valid API key for the selected provider. If you toggle from OpenAI to Anthropic (or vice versa), ensure you‚Äôve entered the corresponding API key in the Settings screen.

- OpenAI key: [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
- Anthropic key: [https://console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

Without a valid key, the app will not be able to fetch AI responses.

## Tips & Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

- **Switching Providers**: When toggling between OpenAI and Anthropic, make sure you have the correct API key set for that provider. The send button will be disabled if no valid key is present.
- **Speech Errors**: If OpenAI TTS fails, the app will automatically fall back to system voices.
- **Debugging**: Check the Xcode console logs for detailed error messages if something goes wrong.
